## Explanation

Bloc Jams functions as a lightweight platform for listening to and housing your music/audio. This was the very first project I worked on at Bloc; it started off as being built entirely in vanilla JS and jQuery before getting refactored to AngularJS.

## Problem

During the course of this project, I realized that the main struggle I had was my trying to grasp the concept of how everything was connected. All the logic makes sense when I visualized it (if someone were to ask me to write it all down in Javascript, I could jump right into it), but once the directives, controllers, and services were added into the mix, my comfort level quickly went from, "wearing sensible shoes while traversing over medium terrain" to "wearing Spanx while scaling a rocky cliff". It was not pretty.

## Solution

I found that drawing or making note of how things connect and flow help with my understanding a bit. One thing that also helped me was seeing how things changed and behaved through trial and error. Finally, of course, my auntie, Google, helps with finding the right resources online.

## Results

The project turned out well (save for a few bugs not covered in the assignment) and functions as anticipated.


## Conclusion

This was a good learning experience and, because of its solid foundation, it gives me a platform on which to continuously improve.
