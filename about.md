Hello! I'm Stephanie, an aspiring software engineer based in the Bay Area.
I love photography, fitness, and esoteric 90s pop culture references.

It's been a wild ride for me through the years and only recently have I realized
the approach of "prototyping" my life in terms of finding out where I truly want
to be with my career and life goals.

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, career opportunities, dance battles, etc.
I'd love to chat!
