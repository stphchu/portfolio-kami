title: 2017 and How I Got Here (Part 1/2)

If there’s anything I’m sure about concerning 2017 it's that this is the year I’ve probably had the most stress-related gastrointestinal issues I’ve ever had in my entire life. Even beyond being in the midst of the current social and political climate, and beyond the fact that a more immature King Joffrey is at the helm of this country, I’ve just been terribly anxious about the future.

Sometime in college, a good number of years ago, when I realized my chosen major in audio wasn’t a field in which I was actually interested, I began feeling like a fraud. I was surrounded by peers whose passions and expertise in that study only served to remind me of how much I didn’t, and couldn’t, fit in. I had to feign interest in the subject whenever people asked me about it (maybe I was hoping with that lying to myself enough times would help my actually believe it) but every time I did, the more I felt like I was losing sight of myself.

I knew this wasn't where I wanted to be.

When I came to the realization of this, I was already halfway through with the program; a part of me wanted to leave and pursue what I wanted to do in the first place (why I hadn’t done this initially is another long story): working with computers/programming. However, another part of me -- the frustrated, prideful, guilty part -- didn’t want to leave feeling like I’ve wasted a year and, ultimately, admitting that I’ve perhaps made a regrettable choice in my academic path. So, in an effort to compromise with myself on this matter, I decided to take computer science courses part-time at a junior college while completing my degree.

Jump forward a few years later with a few jobs dappled along the way in the AV industry**\***: I felt utterly miserable.
It was three months into 2017 and I was already dealing with crippling stress: my grandma had just passed away (exactly a week after her 89th birthday); I didn’t know what to do with my life and felt like a failure, I was stuck in an industry where I constantly felt like a fake, everyone around me seemed to have their lives set, and I was having emotional and mental breakdowns almost every week.

_(**\***I never got a chance to get into software development/engineering because the courses I took didn't really make me feel confident enough to pursue a job in that field. I wasn't prepared and I had nothing to show for it.)_

I went through each workday feeling like I was just going through the motions of living: I woke up, started my hour-long commute to work, worked on whatever was assigned to me that day and, 8.5+ hours later, I’m back in traffic on my way home. To keep myself (mostly) sane, I found outlets to channel my energy: I exercised intensely 1-2 hours a day, listened to podcasts while driving/working, and focused on personal photography projects.

One day at work, while I was browsing the most recent few episodes of the podcast, Hidden Brain, I came across one that caught my attention: “You 2.0: Getting Unstuck”. The description read, _“At one time or another, many of us feel stuck: in the wrong job, the wrong relationship, the wrong city – the wrong life. Psychologists and self-help gurus have all kinds of advice for us when we feel rudderless. This week on Hidden Brain, we conclude our You 2.0 series with a favorite episode exploring a new idea from an unlikely source: Silicon Valley.”_ I remember pausing and staring at the title for a while after I read the blurb.

I **was** feeling stuck.

I **was** feeling like I had been in the wrong job and living the wrong life.

I was looking for answers and I was looking for guidance.

_For the first time in a long while, I was feeling slightly hopeful again._
