title: Hey Alexa
---

I decided to take on the Alexa project without really knowing what to expect: how does it work? What am I going to be doing? What's the learning curve? I had no idea. But, the trend of having voice-enabled AI assistants integrated in our everyday lives appear to be the trajectory of current technology (thus, it seemed like a good idea to familiarize myself at least of one them).

In terms of complexity, the project was pretty straightforward. The frustration only came when I realized that the instructions for the trivia skill template were outdated and I struggled with trying to figure out if I was missing a step, not seeing something, or if the instructions were wrong.

While going through the step-by-step guide, I found myself wanting to understand more -- and wishing the instructions explained, at least briefly -- about what each section of the JSON file affected. I'm not sure how creating other skills will compare to the trivia one but I'm hoping they're just as straightforward.
