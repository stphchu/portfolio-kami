To be honest, I'm kind of intimidated about this next endeavor of having to develop a new skill considering some of the  struggles I've encountered working on the previous two guided assignments; at the same time, though, I'm excited about the possibility of creating something that will (hopefully) work out the way I envisioned it.

I started entertaining some ideas of what to build based on my interests and inconveniences, and eventually settled on one that fell in the former category: health and fitness. It's a simple idea created around the principle of intermittent fasting (IF) where you only eat during certain hours of the day and then fast for the remainder of it (which includes the hours in which you are asleep).

The skill would allow you to start a timer for when you begin a fasting period and, depending on which IF model you're using, alert you when you've reached your goal and can begin tracking your "feasting" period.

Other ideas I've considered and might attempt:

- A Bechdel Test skill where you could check whether a movie passes the test or not.
