The podcast episode presented a concept by Dave Evans (a former engineer who worked on designing the Apple mouse) in which we should view our lives in a way that engineers and designers would approach designing a new product: in order to get what we want, we need to prototype it. This approach is called “design thinking”:

_“Design thinking is about recognizing your constraints, realizing there isn't just one answer, and then trying something: "Building a prototype," getting information from it, and then trying something else.”_ - _Hidden Brain – “You 2.0: Getting Unstuck”_

This idea seemed so obvious and yet unexpected. Thinking back, I realized I've lived my entire life up to that point in a mainly linear fashion: I would choose a path/direction (say, with my career goals and education), and I would just stick with it hoping I would be content or mostly satisfied with my where I happen to be eventually. I remember the monologues that would roll around in my head:

"Maybe, with enough time, I'll learn to like certain things I don't enjoy?
Maybe some crazy random event would change the trajectory of my life and lead me to where I actually want to be?"

No, all of this was silly – I've come to realize that. The strategy about prototyping your life was to test different paths/branches of your life and, if one doesn't work, try something else. Eventually, by using this method, you would be able to build the life you want because you are not spending time and energy on things that don't work.

And that was it. I needed to do something that will take me on a different path because the one I was on wasn’t bringing me any joy or satisfaction. I narrowed down my interests into three different possible directions -- programming, photography, and fitness -– and decided that I needed to start on one.
I don't remember how I came across Bloc, but when I did, I figured that that was where I should start. It made sense at the time: I had already taken a few programming courses and Bloc offered career assistance.

It was difficult, though, to make the jump at first. I was scared of failure. I was worried about this change not working out the way I’d hope it would. And, to top it all off, it was **a lot** of money to spend.
I knew, though, that fear of failing was the very mindset I needed to wean myself off of; the safety of staying in where I was and just hoping for the best (even if it meant being unhappy for some indefinite foreseeable future). I’ve learned that, in fact, this was the exact opposite of what I needed to do.
As described by Dave Evans, _your goal is to fail early and often_.
This idea still terrifies me but I suppose it would be worse knowing I hadn’t tried to, when I could have at any point, design or build a well-lived, joyful life.
