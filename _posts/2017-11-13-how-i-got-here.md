title: 2017 and How I Got Here (Part 1/2)
---
If there’s anything I’m sure about concerning 2017 is that this is the year I’ve probably had the most gastrointestinal issues I’ve ever had in my entire life. Even beyond being in the midst of the current social and political climate, and beyond the fact that a more immature King Joffrey is at the helm of this country, I’ve just been terribly anxious about the future.

Sometime in college (a good number of years ago), when I realized my chosen major in audio wasn’t a subject in which I was actually interested, I began feeling like a fraud. I was surrounded by colleagues whose passions and expertise in that selected field only served to remind me of how much I didn’t, and couldn’t, fit in. At that point, I was already halfway through with the program; a part of me wanted to leave and pursue what I wanted to do in the first place (why I hadn’t done this initially is another long story): computer programming. However, another part of me -- the frustrated, guilty part -- didn’t want to leave feeling like I’ve wasted a year and, ultimately, admitting that I’ve perhaps made a regrettable choice in my academic path. So, in an effort to compromise with myself on this matter, I decided to take computer science courses part-time at a junior college while completing my degree.

Jump forward a few years and a few jobs later in the AV industry: I felt utterly miserable.
It was three months into 2017, my grandma had just passed away (exactly a week after her 89th birthday), I didn’t know what to do with my life and felt like a failure, I was stuck in an industry where I constantly felt like a pretender, everyone around me seemed to have their lives set, and I was having breakdowns almost every week.

I went through each workday feeling like I was just going through the motions of living: I woke up, started my hour-long commute to work, was given random tasks/projects for the day and then, 8.5+ hours later, I’m back in traffic on my way home.
