title: 2017 and How I Got Here (Part 1/2)
---
If there’s anything I’m sure about concerning 2017 is that this is the year I’ve probably had the most gastrointestinal issues I’ve ever had in my entire life. Even beyond being in the midst of the current social and political climate, and beyond the fact that a more immature King Joffrey is at the helm of this country, I’ve just been terribly anxious about the future.

Sometime in college, a good number of years ago, when I realized my chosen major in audio wasn’t a subject in which I was actually interested, I began feeling like a fraud. I was surrounded by colleagues whose passions and expertise in that selected field only served to remind me of how much I didn’t, and couldn’t, fit in. Every moment I had to feign interest in the field, I felt like I was losing sight of myself. At that point, though, I was already halfway through with the program; a part of me wanted to leave and pursue what I wanted to do in the first place (why I hadn’t done this initially is another long story): computer programming. However, another part of me -- the frustrated, guilty part -- didn’t want to leave feeling like I’ve wasted a year and, ultimately, admitting that I’ve perhaps made a regrettable choice in my academic path. So, in an effort to compromise with myself on this matter, I decided to take computer science courses part-time at a junior college while completing my degree.

Jump forward a few years and a few jobs later in the AV industry: I felt utterly miserable.
It was three months into 2017, my grandma had just passed away (exactly a week after her 89th birthday), I didn’t know what to do with my life and felt like a failure, I was stuck in an industry where I constantly felt like a pretender, everyone around me seemed to have their lives set, and I was having breakdowns almost every week.

I went through each workday feeling like I was just going through the motions of living: I woke up, started my hour-long commute to work, worked on whatever was assigned to me that day and, 8.5+ hours later, I’m back in traffic on my way home. To keep myself (mostly) sane, I found outlets to channel my energy: I exercised intensely 1-2 hours a day, listened to podcasts while driving/working, and focused on personal photography projects.

One day at work, while I was browsing the most recent few episodes of the podcast, Hidden Brain, I came across one that caught my attention: “You 2.0: Getting Unstuck”. The description read, “At one time or another, many of us feel stuck: in the wrong job, the wrong relationship, the wrong city – the wrong life. Psychologists and self-help gurus have all kinds of advice for us when we feel rudderless. This week on Hidden Brain, we conclude our You 2.0 series with a favorite episode exploring a new idea from an unlikely source: Silicon Valley.” I paused after reading the blurb.

I was feeling stuck.
I was feeling like I had been in the wrong job and living the wrong life.

I was looking for answers and I was looking for guidance.

Guess I should give it a listen.
